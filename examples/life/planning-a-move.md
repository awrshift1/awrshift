# Example: Planning a Move — Standard Mode

**Scenario:** You're moving your family from Austin to Denver for a new job. Three months to make it happen. One shot to get it right.

**Outcome:** Moved on schedule, under budget, kids enrolled in great schools, nothing fell through the cracks. The framework turned a stressful life event into a project with clear steps.

---

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY (Name the problem)

```
Problem:  New job starts in Denver in 12 weeks. Family of four needs
          to relocate — housing, schools, moving logistics, everything.
Current:  Settled in Austin. Two kids in school. Lease ends in 10 weeks.
Target:   Living in Denver, kids in school, settled before Day 1 at work.
Gap:      No housing, no school enrollment, no moving plan. 12 weeks.
Unknowns: Denver neighborhoods, cost of living difference, school quality,
          moving company reliability, timeline feasibility.
```

## Phase 2: FORMULATE (Ask the right questions)

Research questions:

1. **Housing:** What Denver neighborhoods fit our budget ($2,800/mo rent) with good schools and a reasonable commute?
2. **Schools:** Which elementary schools in those neighborhoods have strong ratings and available spots mid-year?
3. **Cost of living:** How does Denver compare to Austin? Where do we save, where do we pay more?
4. **Moving logistics:** What do cross-state moving companies cost? How far in advance do we book?
5. **Timeline:** Can we realistically scout, decide, pack, and move in 12 weeks?
6. **Safety net:** What gets missed in a move? What do people forget?

You review: "Add a question about winter gear — we're moving from Texas to Colorado. We own zero snow boots."

Updated with 7 questions.

## Phase 3: RESEARCH (Find the evidence)

Key findings:

- **Neighborhoods:** Highlands Ranch (family-friendly, $2,600/mo 3BR), Littleton (close to trails, $2,400/mo), Park Hill (urban, $2,900/mo — over budget)
- **Schools:** Highlands Ranch has 3 elementary schools rated 8+/10. Littleton has 2. Mid-year enrollment is possible with 30 days notice
- **Cost of living:** Denver is ~8% higher than Austin overall. Groceries similar. Utilities higher (heating). No state income tax savings — Colorado has 4.4% flat
- **Moving companies:** Cross-state Austin to Denver averages $4,500-$7,000 for a 3BR. Book 6+ weeks out or pay rush rates
- **Timeline:** Tight but doable. Most families do it in 8-10 weeks. The bottleneck is housing — everything else flows from where you live
- **Commonly forgotten:** Transferring medical records, updating car registration (90 days in Colorado), forwarding mail, canceling Austin utilities, winter clothing

## Phase 4: HYPOTHESIZE (Pick your best guess)

```
H1: If we do a phased move — scout trip first (Week 3-4), then
    pack and relocate (Week 9-11), then we'll be settled by Week 12
    because the scout trip locks in housing and schools before we
    commit to moving logistics.
```

One clear approach. Standard mode — execute H1.

## Phase 5: EVAL-DESIGN (Set the bar)

| # | Metric | Threshold | Why this number |
|---|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Housing secured | Signed lease, within $2,800/mo | Budget ceiling |
| 2 | Schools enrolled | Both kids confirmed before move | 30-day notice requirement |
| 3 | Move completed | By end of Week 11 | One buffer week before job starts |
| 4 | Total move cost | Under $8,000 | Moving + deposits + travel |
| 5 | Nothing critical missed | Zero "oh no" moments in first month | The forgotten items checklist |

You approve. Five clear targets.

## Phase 6: PLAN (Map it out)

```
Weeks 1-2:  RESEARCH & PREP
            - Contact 3 moving companies for quotes (book by Week 3)
            - Apply to Highlands Ranch and Littleton rentals online
            - Request school enrollment packets
            - Start decluttering — less stuff = cheaper move

Weeks 3-4:  SCOUT TRIP (fly to Denver, 3 days)
            - Tour top 3 rental options in person
            - Visit both school districts, meet admin
            - Drive the commute at rush hour
            - Sign lease if right place found

Weeks 5-6:  LOCK LOGISTICS
            - Confirm moving company and date
            - Enroll kids in new school (30-day notice starts)
            - Notify current school of withdrawal
            - Start packing non-essentials (books, off-season clothes)

Weeks 7-8:  PACK & ADMIN
            - Transfer medical/dental records
            - Forward mail (USPS change of address)
            - Cancel Austin utilities, set up Denver utilities
            - Buy winter gear (coats, boots, gloves)

Weeks 9-10: MOVE
            - Movers load (Day 1), drive to Denver (Day 2), unload (Day 3)
            - Unpack essentials: beds, kitchen, kids' rooms first
            - Set up internet, confirm school bus route

Week 11:    SETTLE
            - Kids start new school
            - Register car in Colorado, update driver's license
            - Find new pediatrician, dentist
            - Stock up on groceries, learn the neighborhood

Week 12:    BUFFER
            - First day at new job
            - Handle anything that slipped
```

Rollback: If scout trip reveals Denver won't work — cancel movers (free cancellation until Week 7), stay in Austin, negotiate remote start with employer.

## Phase 7: VERIFY (Fact-check the plan)

- [x] Research supports this approach? — Yes, phased move is standard advice
- [x] Timeline feasible? — Yes, 6-week mover booking fits Week 3 decision
- [x] Budget works? — Moving quotes: $5,200 avg. Deposits: $2,800. Travel: $600. Total ~$8,600 — over budget
- [x] School enrollment timing? — 30-day notice needs enrollment by Week 6. Plan says Week 5-6. Tight.
- [x] Anything missing? — Need to notify kids' current school *before* scout trip, not after

**Verdict: PASS WITH FIXES**

Fixes applied:
1. Budget: cut $800 by selling furniture we'd replace anyway. New total: ~$7,800
2. School notice: moved current school notification to Week 2 (before scout trip)
3. Enrollment: moved to Week 5 to add buffer

## Phase 8: IMPLEMENT (Build it)

Execute the 12-week plan. Each week's tasks tracked and checked off.

Week 3 scout trip locks Highlands Ranch — signed lease on a 3BR at $2,650/mo. Schools visited, enrollment paperwork started same day.

## Phase 9: TEST (Run the checks)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Lease signed within budget? | $2,650/mo — yes |
| Both kids enrolled before move? | Confirmed Week 5 — yes |
| Movers booked and on schedule? | Loaded Day 1, delivered Day 3 — yes |
| Winter gear purchased? | Coats, boots, gloves for all four — yes |
| Mail forwarded, utilities switched? | Done Week 8 — yes |
| Medical records transferred? | Done Week 7 — yes |
| Car registration deadline noted? | 90-day reminder set — yes |

## Phase 10: EVALUATE (Score against the bar)

| # | Metric | Threshold | Actual | Pass? |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Housing secured | Within $2,800/mo | $2,650/mo | Pass |
| 2 | Schools enrolled | Before move day | 4 weeks before | Pass |
| 3 | Move completed | By Week 11 | Week 10 | Pass |
| 4 | Total move cost | Under $8,000 | $7,640 | Pass |
| 5 | Nothing critical missed | Zero surprises | Zero | Pass |

5/5 pass.

## Phase 11: DECIDE (Ship, iterate, or rollback)

**Outcome: SUCCESS**

Family moved to Denver. Kids started school on time. First day at work with zero stress. The $360 under budget went to a family dinner at the new neighborhood spot.

The scout trip was the key decision — it collapsed uncertainty into one 3-day trip and made everything else a logistics exercise.

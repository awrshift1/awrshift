# Example: Choosing a School — Scientific Mode

**Scenario:** A parent choosing between 3 elementary schools for their kid. Multiple viable options, years of impact, no easy undo. This is what Scientific mode was built for.

**Outcome:** After visiting all three schools, running shadow days, and scoring against researched metrics, Riverside Academy (H2) won — strongest combination of academics, extracurriculars, and parent satisfaction. Lincoln had higher test scores but lacked breadth. Greenfield was inspiring but too expensive and too far.

---

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY (Name the problem)

```
Problem:  Family moving to Cedar Hills. Son entering 3rd grade in September.
          Three schools in the district. No clear winner. Need to choose by April.
Current:  No school selected. Kid thriving at current school (arts + math focus).
Target:   School that balances academics, creativity, reasonable commute, and community.
Gap:      No data on any of the three options. All look decent on paper.
Unknowns: Actual teaching quality, class sizes, after-school programs, parent culture.
```

## Phase 2: FORMULATE (Ask the right questions) <-- Human Gate

Research questions:

1. **Academics:** What are test scores, class sizes, and teacher retention rates for each school?
2. **Programs:** What extracurriculars and special programs does each offer? (Arts, STEM, sports, languages)
3. **Commute:** How long is the drive/walk during morning rush? Is there a bus option?
4. **Community:** What do current parents say? What's the school culture like?
5. **Cost:** Are there fees beyond tuition? Uniforms, materials, field trips, after-school care?

**Parent reviews:** "Add a question about how they handle kids who are ahead in math — he's doing 4th grade level already."

Updated to 6 research questions.

## Phase 3: RESEARCH (Find the evidence)

| Topic | Lincoln Elementary | Riverside Academy | Greenfield Montessori |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Test scores** | 92nd percentile (district #2) | 85th percentile | 78th percentile |
| **Class size** | 28 students | 22 students | 18 students |
| **Teacher retention** | 4 yr avg | 7 yr avg | 5 yr avg |
| **Extracurriculars** | Sports (3), math club | Arts (4), STEM lab, sports (3), coding | Project exhibitions, nature program |
| **Commute** | 8 min drive | 14 min drive, bus available | 22 min drive, no bus |
| **Parent reviews** | "Rigorous but rigid" | "Well-rounded, teachers care" | "Amazing philosophy, small community" |
| **Advanced math** | Grade-skip policy exists | Pull-out enrichment groups | Self-paced by design |
| **Annual cost** | $0 (public) | $0 (public charter) | $8,400/yr (private) |
| **After-school** | Until 4pm, $200/mo | Until 5:30pm, $150/mo | Until 4:30pm, included |

## Phase 4: HYPOTHESIZE (Pick your best guess) <-- Human Gate

```
H1 (Lincoln Elementary):
If we choose Lincoln, then strong academics will keep him challenged,
because it has the highest test scores and a grade-skip policy.

H2 (Riverside Academy):
If we choose Riverside, then he'll get both academic rigor and creative growth,
because it combines solid scores with arts and STEM programs.

H3 (Greenfield Montessori):
If we choose Greenfield, then self-paced learning will let him excel at his own speed,
because Montessori method is designed for independent learners.
```

**Parent decides:** "Test all three. Scientific mode. This matters too much to guess."

## Phase 5: EVAL-DESIGN (Set the bar) <-- Human Gate

Five metrics, researched thresholds, applied equally to all three:

| # | Metric | Threshold | Weight | Source |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Academic rating (test scores + enrichment) | > 80th percentile or equivalent | 30% | District data, school reports |
| 2 | Commute time (morning rush) | < 20 min one way | 15% | Google Maps, parent reports |
| 3 | Extracurricular variety | 4+ programs across arts/STEM/sports | 20% | School websites, verified by visit |
| 4 | Parent satisfaction | > 4.0/5.0 average | 20% | GreatSchools, Niche, 5 parent interviews each |
| 5 | Total annual cost | < $5,000/yr (including after-school) | 15% | School admin, fee schedules |

**Pass rule:** Must pass at least 4 of 5 metrics. Cost is a hard constraint — over $5K needs an exceptional reason.

**Parent approves:** "Weights look right. Academics and extracurriculars matter most."

## H1: Lincoln Elementary

**PLAN:** Visit school, attend open house March 5, request shadow day for son, interview 3 parents from the math club.

**VERIFY:** Open house confirmed. Shadow day approved for March 7. Found 3 parents via school Facebook group.

**IMPLEMENT (Visit + Shadow Day):**
- Open house: clean facilities, structured classrooms, principal emphasized test rankings
- Shadow day: son said "it was quiet, everyone just did worksheets"
- Parent interviews: "Great if your kid fits the mold. Not much room for creative types."

**TEST (Observe):**
- Academic enrichment: grade-skip available but only 2 kids used it last year
- Extracurriculars: 3 sports + math club. No arts program. No STEM lab.
- After-school: ends at 4pm sharp, limited flexibility

**EVALUATE:**

| Metric | Threshold | H1 Result | Pass? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Academic rating | > 80th pctl | 92nd pctl | Yes |
| Commute | < 20 min | 8 min | Yes |
| Extracurriculars | 4+ programs | 4 (3 sports + math) | Barely |
| Parent satisfaction | > 4.0/5 | 3.8/5 | No |
| Annual cost | < $5K | $2,400 (after-school) | Yes |

**H1 score: 3.5/5 pass.** Strong academics, weak breadth and culture.

## H2: Riverside Academy

**PLAN:** Visit school, attend STEM showcase March 10, shadow day March 12, interview 3 parents from mixed programs.

**VERIFY:** STEM showcase is public. Shadow day approved. Found parents through Riverside PTA online group.

**IMPLEMENT (Visit + Shadow Day):**
- STEM showcase: kids presented robotics projects, art installations in hallways, real energy in the building
- Shadow day: son said "I made a robot arm and painted in the same day"
- Parent interviews: "Teachers know every kid by name. My daughter went from hating school to asking to go early."

**TEST (Observe):**
- Academic enrichment: pull-out math groups, teacher confirmed they differentiate by level
- Extracurriculars: 4 arts (theater, music, visual art, digital media), STEM lab, coding club, 3 sports
- After-school: until 5:30pm, affordable, includes homework help

**EVALUATE:**

| Metric | Threshold | H2 Result | Pass? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Academic rating | > 80th pctl | 85th pctl | Yes |
| Commute | < 20 min | 14 min (bus option) | Yes |
| Extracurriculars | 4+ programs | 10+ programs | Yes |
| Parent satisfaction | > 4.0/5 | 4.6/5 | Yes |
| Annual cost | < $5K | $1,800 (after-school) | Yes |

**H2 score: 5/5 pass.** Solid across every metric.

## H3: Greenfield Montessori

**PLAN:** Visit school, attend parent info session March 15, shadow day March 17, interview 3 Montessori parents.

**VERIFY:** Info session open to prospective families. Shadow day approved. Connected with parents through local Montessori community group.

**IMPLEMENT (Visit + Shadow Day):**
- Info session: beautiful campus, passionate teachers, small class with mixed ages
- Shadow day: son said "I liked choosing my own work but I missed recess with a big group"
- Parent interviews: "Incredible method. Worth every penny if you can afford it."

**TEST (Observe):**
- Academic enrichment: fully self-paced, no grade levels, advanced math available anytime
- Extracurriculars: project exhibitions and nature walks. No organized sports. No music program.
- Commute: 22 minutes with no bus. Morning traffic makes it worse twice a week.

**EVALUATE:**

| Metric | Threshold | H3 Result | Pass? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Academic rating | > 80th pctl | 78th pctl (different framework) | Borderline |
| Commute | < 20 min | 22 min, no bus | No |
| Extracurriculars | 4+ programs | 2 (exhibitions + nature) | No |
| Parent satisfaction | > 4.0/5 | 4.4/5 | Yes |
| Annual cost | < $5K | $8,400 + extras | No |

**H3 score: 1.5/5 pass.** Inspiring approach, but fails on cost, commute, and breadth.

## COMPARE (Side-by-side) <-- Human Gate

| Metric (Weight) | H1: Lincoln | H2: Riverside | H3: Greenfield | Winner |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Academic rating (30%) | 92nd pctl | 85th pctl | 78th pctl | H1 |
| Commute (15%) | 8 min | 14 min (bus) | 22 min (no bus) | H1 |
| Extracurriculars (20%) | 4 programs | 10+ programs | 2 programs | **H2** |
| Parent satisfaction (20%) | 3.8/5 | 4.6/5 | 4.4/5 | **H2** |
| Annual cost (15%) | $2,400 | $1,800 | $8,400 | **H2** |
| **Metrics passed** | **3.5/5** | **5/5** | **1.5/5** | **H2** |

**Weighted score:** H1 = 72 | **H2 = 88** | H3 = 54

The kid's own words after shadow days: Lincoln was "quiet." Riverside was "I made a robot arm and painted." Greenfield was "I missed recess with a big group."

## DECIDE (Ship, iterate, or rollback) <-- Human Gate

**Winner: H2 — Riverside Academy.**

It is the only school that passed every metric. Strongest extracurriculars, highest parent satisfaction, lowest cost, and the kid lit up when he talked about it. Lincoln had better test scores, but a 7-percentile gap does not outweigh the difference in culture, programs, and the fact that the kid actually wants to go there.

**Action:** Submit enrollment application by April 1. Request pull-out math enrichment group on day one. Sign up for STEM lab and theater.

**Rollback:** If Riverside does not work out after one semester, Lincoln is 8 minutes away and accepts mid-year transfers.

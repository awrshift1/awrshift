# Example: Marketing Strategy — Standard Mode

**Scenario:** You're the Head of Marketing at a B2B SaaS company (project management tool, 2,000 paying customers, $45 ARR per user). The CEO just approved a $50K Q3 marketing budget — the biggest you've ever had. Your instinct says "run Facebook ads." The board wants measurable pipeline growth. You have 3 months to show results.

**Outcome:** The research phase killed the Facebook ads idea (B2B conversion rates are terrible there) and surfaced a channel mix that generated 340 qualified leads at $88 each — 40% under the target cost. The approval points caught two budget mistakes before they burned real money.

---

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY (Name the problem)

```
Problem:  Q3 pipeline target is 250 qualified leads. Current organic rate: ~60/quarter.
          Need to generate 190+ additional leads with the $50K budget.
Current:  Marketing is content + SEO only. No paid channels. No outbound.
Target:   250 qualified leads in Q3, cost per lead under $150.
Gap:      190 leads to fill. No paid infrastructure. No landing pages. No ad accounts.
Unknowns: Which channels work for B2B SaaS at our price point, realistic CPL by channel,
          whether $50K is enough, how long before paid channels produce results.
```

## Phase 2: FORMULATE (Ask the right questions) -- Checkpoint

Research questions:

1. **Channel fit:** Which paid channels actually work for B2B SaaS with $45/user ARR? (LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, Reddit, content syndication?)
2. **Benchmarks:** What's the realistic cost per lead for each channel in the project management space?
3. **Timeline:** How long does each channel take to ramp up? Can we get results in Q3 or does it take a quarter to warm up?
4. **Competition:** Where are our competitors spending? What are they doing that we aren't?
5. **Content leverage:** Can we use our existing blog content (80+ articles) as fuel for paid campaigns?

You review: "Add a question about partner marketing and integrations. We just launched a Slack integration — can we co-market with partners?"

Updated to 6 research questions.

## Phase 3: RESEARCH (Find the evidence)

Key findings:

- **Channel benchmarks (B2B SaaS, $30-60 ARR):**

| Channel | Avg CPL | Ramp Time | B2B Fit | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| LinkedIn Ads | $75-150 | 2-3 weeks | High | Best targeting for job titles, company size |
| Google Search Ads | $40-90 | 1-2 weeks | High | Captures active intent ("project management tool") |
| Facebook/Meta Ads | $25-50 | 1 week | **Low** | CPL looks cheap but lead quality is poor for B2B — 80% don't convert to meetings |
| Reddit Ads | $30-70 | 2 weeks | Medium | Good for developer/PM communities, early stage |
| Content syndication | $50-100 | 4-6 weeks | Medium | Gated content on platforms like Bombora, TechTarget |
| Partner co-marketing | $0-20 | 4-8 weeks | High | Free if partner agrees, but slow to set up |

- **Competitor analysis:** Top 3 competitors spend heavily on Google Search ($15-20K/mo estimated) and LinkedIn ($8-12K/mo). None are on Reddit. Two run webinar funnels.
- **Content leverage:** 80+ blog articles can be repurposed into LinkedIn ads (top 10 posts), Google ad landing pages (comparison pages), and gated guides (combine 3-4 posts into downloadable playbooks).
- **Facebook reality check:** B2B SaaS companies report 3-5% meeting-to-lead rate from Facebook vs 15-25% from LinkedIn and Google. The "cheap CPL" is a trap — cost per *qualified* lead is actually $200-400 on Facebook.
- **Partner opportunity:** Slack's partner directory gets 50K+ monthly visits. Co-marketing webinar with Slack could generate 100-200 registrations.

## Phase 4: HYPOTHESIZE (Pick your best guess) -- Checkpoint

```
H1: If we split the $50K budget across Google Search (40%), LinkedIn (35%),
    and content/partner (25%), then we'll generate 250+ qualified leads at
    under $150 CPL, because Google captures active buyers, LinkedIn targets
    ideal company profiles, and content/partner adds low-cost volume.
```

You review: "I was wrong about Facebook. The data is clear — bad channel for B2B. Let's go with this split. Standard mode."

## Phase 5: EVAL-DESIGN (Set the bar) -- Checkpoint

| # | Metric | Threshold | Why |
|---|--------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Total qualified leads | >= 250 in Q3 | Board pipeline target |
| 2 | Blended cost per lead | < $150 | $50K / 250 = $200 max, want buffer |
| 3 | Lead-to-meeting rate | > 15% | Industry benchmark for B2B SaaS |
| 4 | Channel diversity | No single channel > 60% of leads | Avoid single point of failure |
| 5 | Month-over-month growth | Each month > previous | Campaigns should improve with optimization |

You approve: "Good. The channel diversity one is smart — don't want to be dependent on Google if CPCs spike."

## Phase 6: PLAN (Map it out) -- Checkpoint

```
BUDGET ALLOCATION:

Google Search Ads:    $20,000 (40%)
  - 10 campaigns targeting "project management tool" + competitor keywords
  - 3 landing pages: comparison page, feature page, free trial page
  - Expected: 250-500 clicks/mo at $15-25 CPC, 20% conversion = 50-100 leads/mo

LinkedIn Ads:         $17,500 (35%)
  - Sponsored content targeting: PMs, Engineering Managers, CTOs at 50-500 person companies
  - Retargeting pool from website visitors (install pixel Week 1)
  - Top 10 blog posts repurposed as ad creative
  - Expected: 120-230 leads at $75-140 CPL

Content + Partner:    $12,500 (25%)
  - 3 gated playbooks built from existing blog content: $3K (design + editing)
  - Slack co-marketing webinar: $1.5K (production costs)
  - Reddit ads targeting r/projectmanagement, r/startups: $5K
  - Email nurture sequence for non-converting leads: $3K (tool + copy)
  - Expected: 80-150 leads at $40-80 CPL

TIMELINE:

Month 1 (July):   SETUP + LAUNCH
  - Week 1: Landing pages live, ad accounts set up, LinkedIn pixel installed
  - Week 2: Google Search campaigns launch (10 campaigns, 3 ad groups each)
  - Week 3: LinkedIn campaigns launch, first gated playbook published
  - Week 4: Reddit ads launch, Slack webinar scheduled for Month 2

Month 2 (August):  OPTIMIZE
  - Pause underperforming Google keywords (CPL > $120)
  - Scale winning LinkedIn audiences
  - Run Slack co-marketing webinar
  - Launch retargeting campaigns (site visitors who didn't convert)
  - Second gated playbook published

Month 3 (September): SCALE + CLOSE
  - Double down on top 3 performing campaigns
  - Third playbook + Reddit AMA
  - Final push on retargeting
  - Compile results for board presentation
```

Backup plan: If Google CPL exceeds $100 after Month 1, reallocate $5K from Google to LinkedIn and content. If total leads are below 60 after Month 1, activate outbound email as an emergency channel ($2K for tool + list).

You approve: "The backup plan is key. Let's also set a Week 3 review to check if the landing pages are converting before we scale spend."

## Phase 7: VERIFY (Fact-check the plan)

- [x] Budget adds up? $20K + $17.5K + $12.5K = $50K. Yes.
- [x] CPL estimates realistic? Cross-checked with industry data from research phase. Yes.
- [x] Timeline feasible? Landing pages can be built in a week using existing templates. Ad accounts take 24-48 hours. Yes.
- [x] Content ready? 80+ blog posts exist. Top 10 identified. Playbook curation: 2 days each. Yes.
- [x] Slack partnership confirmed? Initial conversation yes, formal agreement needed. **Risk: medium.** Add backup: if Slack webinar falls through, run solo webinar with same budget.

**Verdict: PASS WITH FIXES**

Fix: Added solo webinar as backup if Slack partnership doesn't materialize.

## Phase 8: IMPLEMENT (Execute the plan)

Month 1: All campaigns launched on schedule. Google started generating leads by Day 10. LinkedIn took two weeks to optimize — first week CPL was $160 (too high), adjusted targeting to exclude enterprise companies.

Month 2: Slack webinar happened (142 registrants, 89 attendees, 34 qualified leads). Google top 3 campaigns producing 80% of leads. Paused 4 underperformers. Reddit surprisingly strong in r/projectmanagement — $45 CPL.

Month 3: Retargeting campaigns converting at 28% (site visitors who saw ads twice). Scaled Google and LinkedIn winners. Third playbook underperformed — topic was too niche.

## Phase 9: TEST (Check the numbers)

| Channel | Spend | Leads | CPL | Meeting Rate |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Google Search | $19,200 | 152 | $126 | 22% |
| LinkedIn | $17,100 | 98 | $174 | 18% |
| Reddit | $4,800 | 42 | $114 | 12% |
| Content/Webinar | $6,900 | 48 | $144 | 24% |
| **Total** | **$48,000** | **340** | **$141** | **19%** |

$2,000 remaining in budget (third playbook came under cost).

## Phase 10: EVALUATE (Score against the bar)

| # | Metric | Threshold | Actual | Pass? |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Total qualified leads | >= 250 | 340 | Pass |
| 2 | Blended CPL | < $150 | $141 | Pass |
| 3 | Lead-to-meeting rate | > 15% | 19% | Pass |
| 4 | Channel diversity | No channel > 60% | Google = 45% (largest) | Pass |
| 5 | Month-over-month growth | Each month > previous | 78 -> 118 -> 144 | Pass |

5/5 pass.

**Surprise findings:**
- LinkedIn CPL ($174) was over the $150 target individually, but lead quality was highest (18% meeting rate, and those meetings converted to paid at 2x the rate of Google leads).
- Reddit was the dark horse — cheapest CPL, decent quality, zero competitors advertising there.
- Facebook would have burned $12-15K to produce ~60 low-quality leads. The research phase saved roughly $12K in wasted spend.

## Phase 11: DECIDE (Ship, iterate, or rollback) -- Checkpoint

**Outcome: SUCCESS — 340 qualified leads, $141 blended CPL, 36% over target.**

Q4 recommendations:
- Increase Google Search budget by 30% (proven channel, room to scale)
- Keep LinkedIn at current spend (expensive but high-quality leads)
- Double Reddit budget (underinvested channel with best CPL)
- Drop third playbook concept, invest in webinar series instead (Slack webinar had best meeting rate)
- Reallocate the $2K surplus to a second partner webinar

The critical moment was the research phase. The instinct was "run Facebook ads" — every B2C marketer's default. But the data showed Facebook is a trap for B2B: cheap clicks, terrible conversion. That one insight redirected $15K+ toward channels that actually work.
